# GPS Notepad

REMOVE PHONEGAP SHORT CIRCUIT

A simple GPS App that allows you to make notes on any GPS location you reach. At your direction the app saves the GPS information, and optionally saves your notes and an image you take of the location. The image is taken through the app. At this time, it does not import images (or pictures) from your mobile device.
